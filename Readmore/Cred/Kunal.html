          <p>Kunal Shah is an Indian entrepreneur who is a co-founder of freecharge and also the founder of Cred which
            is contemplated as the second fastest growing startup in india. He is very active on social media platforms
            such as twitter and linkedin</p>

          <h1>How it began?</h1>
          <p> <span>K</span>unal Shah graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy from Wilson College.
            Kunal Shah was pursuing MBA from "Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies", but dropped out.
            because he didnt like the structured programmes for learning. He started to study on his own.
            His first startup was Paisaback, later Kunal Shah and Sandeep Tandan found Freecharge on August 2010.It is a
            financial
            services company which allows customers to pay bills such as electricity, telephone as well as recharge
            mobile, recharge DTH etc. later freecharge was acquired by snapdeal for approximatley 450 million dollars.
            <p>
              He has travelled a lot in india after successful launch of freecharge and he realised that per capita income
              of indian people is very low so he knew that they will have to focus on people of certain category and
              that's why initially he allowed only the people with credit card score more than 750 will be allowed to do
              transactions. Kunal Shah says if you want to start a start up then invest your time in planning better
              ideas. According to him Poor planning is the reason why most of the startups fail.
              He than became angel investor for many companies like unacademy, TVF, Rupeek and many more.
              And later on Kunal Shah founded cred the financial technology company in the year 2018. Its headquarter is
              located at bangalore, karnataka, india.

          <h1>Cred</h1>
          <p> CRED is an app which allows users or customers to make payments using credit cards for which they give
            rewards to their users. After some time cred introduced some more useful features on cred such as they added
            features which allowed users to make different kinds of payments such as house rent payment.
            After just 3 years, that is in the year 2021 the company had around 5.9 million users/customers and CRED has
            been used for almost 20% of credit card bill payments across india. Kunal Shah describes CRED as a TrustTech
            company rather than just a fintech company. Because Kunal Shah believes Indian people love to sugar quote,
            they do not like blunt people. Cred has 5 different products which are CRED RentPay, CRED Cash, CRED Pay,
            CRED Store, CRED Travel Store.

          <h1>Buisness model </h1>
          <p> They partner with startups and Buisnesses to display offers
            on their app. In return the users who redeem cred coins become customers to
            their Buisnesses. As more credit card user join the app, more financial data is
            available at their disposal. Financial Institutions profit as it is easier to target
            customers knowing their interests.</p>
